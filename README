acts_as_abusable
================

Tiny plugin to mark any rails model instance as an abuse or site's community guideline violation.

Example
-------

class Photo < ActiveRecord::Base
  acts_as_abusable
end

This gives you:

´
# All reported abuses
penthouse_sweetie_photo.reported_abuses

# Positive abuses
penthouse_sweetie_photo.reported_abuses.confirmed

# Still not evaluated abuses
penthouse_sweetie_photo.reported_abuses.pending
´

And a new ´Abuse´ model:

abuse.confirmed?
abuse.confirm!
# URL used as base for 
abuse.referer
# Resource that supposely is an abuse
abuse.resource
